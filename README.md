I'm a Junior Full Stack Web Developer with a **strong focus on front-end development and design**. I have a passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. My proficiency in design tools like **Figma** and **Photoshop**, combined with my web development skills, enable me to bring creative designs to life.
